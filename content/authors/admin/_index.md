I'm an Informatics Application Developer @ [Atorus](https://www.atorusresearch.com/).  My goal is to share trivial and occasionally useful R content, learn from and connect with others in the data community, and contribute to open source. I live in Philadelphia with my amazing wife Molly, our two cats, Mango and Phil, and our dog Donut.

I'm a Data Analyst at the National Board of Medical Examiners. In my spare time, I'm a freelance analyst, specializing in survey design and analysis, data cleaning and visualization with R and SPSS, and ad-hoc data requests of all types. My goal is to share trivial and occasionally useful R content, learn from and connect with others in the data community, and am always open to exploring a freelance opportunity. I live in Philadelphia with my amazing wife Molly and our two cats, Mango and Phil.
